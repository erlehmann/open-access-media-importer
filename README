The aim of this project is to write a tool that would:
* regularly spider PubMed Central to locate audio and video files published in the supplementary materials of CC BY-licensed articles in the Open subset
* convert these files to OGG
* upload them to Wikimedia Commons, along with the respective metadata
* provide for easy extension to other CC-BY sources, beyond PubMed Central
* (possibly) suggest Wikipedia articles for which the video might be relevant

Configuration:
    Copy the userconfig.example file to $HOME/config/open-access-media-importer/userconfig”. Uncomment the lines for “username” and “password” and fill in your username and password for Wikimedia Commons.

Import of supplementary materials by DOI:
    1. Look up the DOIs of one or more open access articles with supplementary materials.
    2. Pipe the DOIs to the oami_pmc_doi_import script, like “echo 10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030212 | oami_pmc_doi_import”

Import of supplementary materials by PMCID:
    1. Look up the PMCIDs of one or more open access articles with supplementary materials.
    2. Pipe the PMCIDs to the oami_pmc_pmcid_import script, like “echo PMC3751716 | oami_pmc_pmcid_import”

A screencast showing usage can be played back with “ttyplay screencast”.
